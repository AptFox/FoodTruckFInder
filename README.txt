A README file that contains instructions on how to do the following on Linux or Mac
OSX (if you need an exception to this, let us know):

○ install dependencies.
○ build your program.
○ run your program, with example commands on how to run it if necessary.

3. A one- or two-paragraph write-up describing, at a high level, what you would do
differently if you were asked to build this as a full-scale web application. In your write-up,
please focus on the technical differences between the command-line program and the
web application, rather than on the product differences.
