Steps to convert FoodTruckFinder to a web-app:

FRONT-END
---------
Write a front-end for the application in Angular or PrimeFaces (Really anything compatible with Java).

BACK-END
--------
Add logs everywhere.
Modify MVC to accommodate new UI framework.
Decouple UI from back-end, with Interfaces and Dependency Injection (Spring Framework).
Package application into a WAR instead of a JAR.

INFRASTRUCTURE
--------------
Web Server: Apache Tomcat
Deploy on AWS Elastic Beanstalk instance (already has Tomcat)

Prompt:
A one- or two-paragraph write-up describing, at a high level, what you would do
differently if you were asked to build this as a full-scale web application. In your write-up,
please focus on the technical differences between the command-line program and the
web application, rather than on the product differences.
